## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.

//:  Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
print("The code does compile, because variables have a built in function that allow them to be updated in later lines of code different from constants that can not be changed after being declared as it is seen as redeclaring by the code")
